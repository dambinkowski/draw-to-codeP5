------ Draw to Code - p5 converter -----
purpose:
posibility to use mouse drawing to create p5 code of drawn element,
this could make procces of making p5 games etc. much faster
use examples:
I want to draw a interesting tree for my p5 game: I just use vertex and
rect tools with colors and within seconds I am able to draw very interesting
tree, normally the process would take many times over, after that easily press
copy to clipboard button and paste it to the game code.
